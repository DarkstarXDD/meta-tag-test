### Built with
- HTML5 / CSS
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
#


### New things I learned
- How to use `grid-template-columns` property.
- Not all images need to have text in the `alt` attribute. If you use images as icons for decoration purposes, no need to describe what that image is using an `alt` attribute. In those cases set the `alt` attribute of the `img` to be null. `alt=""`.
